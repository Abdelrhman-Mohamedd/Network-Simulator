# Mister A Network-Simulator
a lightweight and easy-to-use network simulator built with Python. It allows users to simulate basic network topologies, analyze traffic flow, and visualize network behavior in a controlled environment. This project aims to help network engineers, students, and enthusiasts understand the core concepts of networking, including routing, switching, and packet transmission.

Key Features:

Support for basic protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP.
Visualize the flow of data packets between nodes.
Customizable network configurations (subnets, IP addresses, etc.).
Simulate traffic generation and monitor network performance.
Ability to simulate packet loss, latency, and other network conditions.

Technologies Used:

Python (core language)
socket for network communication
threading for simulating concurrent nodes/routers
matplotlib or networkx (optional) for visualization
Optional libraries like scapy for packet manipulation and analysis
